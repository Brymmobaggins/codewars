/* DESCRIPTION:
In this kata you will have to write a function that takes litres and pricePerLitre (in dollar) as arguments.

Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per litre cannot be more than 25 cents. Return the total cost rounded to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.

Good Luck!
Note
1 Dollar = 100 Cents */


function fuelPrice(litres, pricePerLiter) {
    for (var i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2) { //discount loop
        if (litres >= i) {
            pricePerLiter -= 0.05;
        }
    }
    return Math.round(litres * pricePerLiter * 100) / 100;;
}
