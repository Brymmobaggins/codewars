/**
 * After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.
 *
 * You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.
 *
 * Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
 *
 * Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).
